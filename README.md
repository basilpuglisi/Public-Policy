# AI Provider Plurality — Congressional Package

**Infrastructure for Safe AI in America**

## The Proposal

The American public does not need more AI regulation. The American public needs AI infrastructure.

This package proposes three legislative actions:

1. **Fund GOPEL** (Governance Orchestrator Policy Enforcement Layer) as national AI infrastructure — the government builds the road, AI platforms are the vehicles
2. **Mandate API accessibility** for AI companies operating in the United States — vehicles must meet safety standards to use public roads
3. **Invest in small AI platforms** to guarantee the competitive diversity that makes governance real — SBIR/STTR model

Phase 0 requires no new appropriation. Agencies adopt manual governance using existing resources to generate baseline data.

This is not a proposal for more regulation. This is the engineering that makes less regulation safe.

## What Is GOPEL?

GOPEL is a non-cognitive governance agent that performs zero cognitive work. It dispatches tasks to multiple AI platforms, collects their outputs, routes them through checkpoint gates, logs every decision with cryptographic binding to a human identity, pauses when human approval is required, hashes records for tamper evidence, and reports governance metrics. Seven deterministic operations. The architecture cannot be co-opted because there is nothing to co-opt.

GOPEL follows the same infrastructure precedent as the FAA (aviation), FHWA (highways), SEC (finance), FCC (telecommunications), and FERC (energy). The government did not invent cars, phones, planes, or electricity. It built the infrastructure that made them safe and accessible.

## Three Operating Models

| Model 1: Agent Responsible AI | Model 2: Agent AI Governance | Model 3: Manual Human AI Governance |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Growth-speed operations. Single checkpoint. Routine, lower-risk tasks | Structured gates. Human approval at each role. High-risk decisions | Full manual orchestration. Highest-consequence decisions and framework validation |

Organizations choose their model. Markets function. The infrastructure accommodates both speed and accountability.

## Policy Alignment

This package responds to:

- **Executive Order 14179** — Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence
- **Executive Order 14365** — Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence
- **OMB M-25-21** — Federal AI governance and trust
- **OMB M-25-22** — Federal AI acquisition
- **NIST AI RMF 1.0** — Govern, Map, Measure, Manage
- **EU AI Act, Article 14** — Human oversight requirements
- **ISO 42001, prEN 18286:2025, GPAI Code of Practice 2025**

The architecture meets the highest international compliance standards while preserving American growth and free markets.
